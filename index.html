                        <p class="par1 fadeIn">And I’m currently a sophomore studying for a Bachelor of Secondary Education, 
                            majoring in English, at Wesleyan University Philippines.<br> I’m passionate about exploring things that make me unique and enjoy developing my skills in creativity. 
                            Outside of academics, I love drawing,<br> which helps me stay balanced and inspired. 
                            My goal is to become a well-known artist, and I’m excited to keep learning and growing along the<br> way.</p>
                        
                        <p class="par2 fadeIn"><span class="trainee">I am currently</span> a trainee cartoonist in an organization called Genre at my school.
                        Being part of this <br> group has allowed me to develop my artistic skills while contributing to the creative projects we undertake.
                        I am actively <br> involved in various organizational activities, collaborating with team members and participating in events 
                         that foster both<br> personal growth and community engagement.</p>

                         <p class="par3 fadeIn"><span class="from">From a young</span> age, participating in slogan and poster-making contests sparked my passion for art.<br> This early interest has 
                            evolved  into a dedication to publication and ballpoint pen art, where I strive to express my unique vision and<br> personal growth.
                             Beyond my studies, art continues to be my driving force, providing balance, inspiration, and the determination<br> to pursue my goal of 
                             becoming a well-known artist. Each drawing brings me closer to fulfilling this dream  and fuels my motivation<br> to improve with every creation.</p>
